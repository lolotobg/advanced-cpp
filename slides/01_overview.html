salaries for the entire engineers department are secured for ten
years ahead. Facebook has pretty interesting relationship with C++.
Facebook was initially written in PHP. After PHP couldn't scale
enough Facebook started compiling PHP to C++ and compiling the PHP
in a single 1.2GB CGI program. Now Facebook are using the HipHopVM -
virtual machine for PHP with JIT.

drains the battery very fast.

Android, PlayStation 4, XBox</li></ul><aside class="notes">This may sound strange. As long as you are using standard C++ you
have covered more platforms than with any other language. For
example if you have a library that handles the platform specific
window creation, drawing and reading input like SDL2.0, you get
all PC platforms, iOS and Android.

with Classes" in Bell Labs</p><p class="fragment fade-in">1983 - C++ is born. cfront works by translating
C++ to C and compiling</p></section><section><h2>C++ revisions</h2><ul><li>C++ '98</li><li>C++ '03</li><li>C++ '11</li><li>C++ '14</li><li>C++ '17</li></ul><aside class="notes">*C++* is not the same language any more. The new standard has
changed significantly the language.
</aside></section><section><h2>What was new in C++ 03 TR1</h2><ul><li>shared_ptr</li><li>regex</li><li>random</li><li>quite a lot of math functions</li><li>...</li></ul><aside class="notes">How many people have heard of it? How many have used any
feature of it? It wasn't impemented by Visual Studio, making
it pretty useless. GCC just took the headers out of boost, but
kept using an old version.
</aside></section><section><h2>What is new in C++ 11</h2><ul><li>Multi-thread machine model</li><li>lambda functions</li><li>C++ 03 TR1 is part of the language</li></ul></section><section><h2>What probably will be new in C++ 14</h2><ul><li>boost::filesystem</li><li>cpp_netlib - HTTP client and server<ul><li>sockets - TCP, UDP</li><li>asyncronous IO</li><li>HTTP</li></ul></li></ul><aside class="notes">49 years after the invention of hierarchial filesystems and 31
years after the creation of C++, Standard C++ still doesn't
know anything about directories. So instead of branging about
this, we should be ashamed. If cpp_netlib gets in the standard
it is going to be pretty huge - C++ will finally understand
that computers are not single machines living in vacuum.
</aside></section><section><h2>What might be new in C++ 17</h2><ul><li>Visual Studio are pushing async keyword</li></ul></section><section><h2>What is new in the C++ community</h2><ul><li>compilers are developing faster</li><li>2 already implement the C++ 11 language</li><li>companies are supporting C++</li><li>Going Native, C++Next</li></ul><aside class="notes">What is more interesting is that the whole C++ community has
changed. There is much wider support from the software
industry. Two of the three major compilers already implement
the standard. The third one is on its way.  Boost is
developing faster - boost.context and boost coroutine have
come true after 3 or 4 years, boost.log has been in
development even longer (although it is far from perfect in my
opinion)
</aside></section></section><section><h2>Compilers</h2><ul><li>Microsoft Visual Studio</li><li>GCC</li><li>clang</li></ul><aside class="notes">Both GCC and clang are claiming to implement the C++11 standard.
There something missing from their respective standard libraries,
but this is getting better. Microsoft Visual Studio is working on
getting standards complient.
