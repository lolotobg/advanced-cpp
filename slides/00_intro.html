libraries and tools that game developers are using in their games.

</aside></section><section><h1>What we are going to talk about?</h1></section><section><h1>C++</h1><p>By C++ we are going always to understand the Standard C++.<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft" target="_blank" rel="external">Freely accessible draft</a></p></section><section><h1>Modern C++</h1><p>The alternative title</p><aside class="notes">C++ is not the same language any more. The new standard has
changed the language significantly. What is more interesting that
the whole C++ community has changed - there are at least two,
three major conferances a year, backed by Microsoft, Google, etc.
There are lots of talks, videos, articals for the new features in
C++.  And C++ is gaing more and more speed - we are already
expecting C++ '14 and C++ '17

</aside></section><section><h1>Practical C++</h1><p>The alternative-alternative title</p><p>The kind of C++ used in practice - it is converging with the
modern C++.
</p><aside class="notes">The C++ that is used in day-to-day work is moving rapidly towards
the modern C++, because compilers are developing much faster and
developers are being actively educated for the new features in the
language. And we are going to cover few area in which C++ doesn't
shine yet.
</aside></section><section><h3>Why not Modern C++ then?</h3><ul><li>Lots of information avaliable</li><li>Knowledge of the internals of the language</li><li>Patterns in the language</li></ul><aside class="notes">This course will not be just another praise of the great new
features in C++11. There are plently of videos, lectures, blog
posts about that. Instead we focus on the details of C++, how it
works and how to use it.
</aside></section><section><h3>Contents (1)</h3><ol><li>Overview of C++</li><li>Resource management</li><li>Move semantic</li><li>Smart pointers - auto_ptr, unique_ptr, shared_ptr</li><li>Namespaces, argument-dependent lookup</li><li>Designing of an API, shared libraries, pImpl</li></ol><aside class="notes">We are going through a brief overview of C++. Then probably the
most difficult part of C++ - managing system resources - memory,
file handles, sockets, etc. Then - the first C++11 feature - move
semantic - allowing to move resources from object to object. We
will see how smart pointer help us model resource ownership.
Namespaces and ADL are often understimated featutes of the
language. Then the first non-standard C++ practical topic - APIs
and shared libraries.
</aside></section><section><h3>Contents (2)</h3><ol start="7"><li>Error handling and exceptions</li><li>Lambda functions, generic functions (signals)</li><li>Templates and type-erasure</li><li>Static polymorhism and expression templates</li><li>Standard Library - strings and regular expressions</li><li>Standard Library - containers</li></ol><aside class="notes">Then we are going to the hard part - error handling and exceptions
- the bastard feature of C++. Some fresh air with lambda
  functions, generic functions and a practical note with signals.
  Then we take a deep dive with generic programming - templates,
  type-erasure, static polymorhism and expression templates. The
  we are going in the land of the standard library. We start with
  strings and regular expressions, then containers.
  
  </aside></section><section><h3>Contents (3)</h3><ol start="13"><li>Standard Library - iterators and algorithms</li><li>Multithreaded and asynchronous programming</li><li>Inheritance and polymorphism</li><li>Memory management - custom allocators, pool allocators and DLLs</li><li>Libraries and tools</li><li>The future of C++</li></ol><aside class="notes">Then we are going deeper into the STL with iterators and
algorithms. Multithreaded and asynchronous programming are next.
Then we will see how inheritance and polymorhism actually work. At
the end we'll going for a trip in the dark side of C++ - memory
management. The desert is left for some usefull C++ libraries and
where C++ is actually going.
